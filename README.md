# Abstract 

The bovine genome spans approximately 2.6 billion base pairs. We aim to understand the potential deleterious effect of variation at every base in the genome. Interpreting the effects of bovine genetic variation is critical in studies of health, welfare, and sustainable improvement. However, current variant-prioritization approaches often emphasize coding changes, rely on single annotation types, and limit noncoding regions.
We developed BovCADD, an every-base, bovine-specific, nucleotide-level deleteriousness score that includes Bos taurus and Bos indicus. BovCADD combines evolutionary constraint, local DNA sequence context, epigenomic and regulatory annotations, and gene/protein features in a supervised machine-learning model. We trained a logistic regression on 41.9 million high-frequency bovine-derived alleles (“proxy-benign”) contrasted with 41.9 million simulated variants, and precomputed scores for all 8.1 billion possible single-nucleotide substitutions.
BovCADD was validated using known pathogenic variants, functional consequence classes, and background selection from ~4,000 cattle genomes worldwide. At the individual and population levels, BovCADD enables genome-wide profiling of rare deleterious variation, revealing distinct distributions of gene-based burden and genetic load across populations. Therefore, BovCADD improves prioritization of putatively deleterious variants across breeds, reference assemblies, and diverse genetic architectures, providing a comprehensive bovine-specific resource beyond existing cattle annotation approaches.
